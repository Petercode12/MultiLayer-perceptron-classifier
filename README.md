# Spark MLlib (MultiLayer perceptron classifier)
Multilayer perceptron classifier (MLPC) is a classifier based on the feedforward artificial neural network.

### Description
This project demonstrates the usage of a MultiLayer perceptron classifier on a sample dataset. The project goes through the following steps:
1. Reading input data
2. Exploring schema
3. Rename the column
4. Train, validation and test split
5. Building the pipeline
6. Evaluate the model with precision, recall, and accuracy scores
7. Plots and visualizations
